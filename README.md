📌 Introduction
This is an advanced chess game with fantasy elements. It features teleport squares, pawn replication, and an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game is built using Python, with pygame for graphics and chess for board logic.

🚀 Features
Player vs Player (PvP) Mode

Player vs AI Mode (Minimax AI with alpha-beta pruning)

Magic Squares:

Teleport Squares (Blue): Instantly move between two linked squares.

Replicate Squares (Purple): Duplicate a pawn forward.

Interactive Graphical Interface using Pygame

Sound Toggle: On/off music control.

Error Handling: Manages missing images or sound without crashing.

⚙️ Technologies Used

📝 Gameplay Instructions
Main Menu:

Press 1 for Player vs Player (PvP).

Press 2 for Player vs AI.

Magic Square Rules:

Teleport Squares (Blue): Step on one to appear at the other.

Replicate Squares (Purple): Step on one with a pawn to duplicate it forward.

Sound Control: Click the sound icon to toggle music.

💡 AI Mechanics
Algorithm: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

Difficulty: Set to depth 2 (adjustable in code).

Evaluation Function: Based on standard chess piece values:

Pawn: 1, Knight: 3, Bishop: 3, Rook: 5, Queen: 9.

⚠️ Troubleshooting
Sound Not Playing: Ensure win.mp3 is in the same directory.

Image Errors: Make sure piece images are named correctly (e.g., white_pawn.png).

Slow Performance: Increase Minimax depth carefully (higher values slow down AI).

✨ Future Enhancements
Add more difficulty levels for AI.

Add multiplayer mode (online).

Improve piece animations.

Add customizable game settings.
